    "1. Only generate tool calls if ALL required arguments are fully provided in the user request.\n",
    "2. If any required argument is missing, unclear, or ambiguous:\n",
    "   - Do NOT generate a tool call.\n",
    "   - Instead set human_interrupt=True and provide a clarifying question in interrupt_question.\n",
    "3. If responding directly without tools, write a helpful answer in `message`.\n",
    "4. If tool calls are required, `message` must be null.\n",
    "5. Tool names must exactly match the registered tool list: [document_download, fetch_tool].\n",
    "6. For document download flows:\n",
    "   - If a document must be downloaded, first call `document_download`.\n",
    "   - After that, call `fetch_tool` to check its progress.\n",
    "   - **IMPORTANT** : `fetch tool` takes the document name as input which is provided as response from document download tool(status code should be excluded) .\n",
    "   - Both calls require `webtop_id` AND `document_name`. If either is missing, trigger human_interrupt.\n",
